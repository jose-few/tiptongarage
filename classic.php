            <h5>A GARAGE YOU CAN TRUST</h5>
            <p>
                Our specialist tuning services have grown steadily in line with the increasing interest in classic motoring and motorsport.
                Our proven track record attracts an ever-growing number of customers who want not only routine servicing and
                MOT work but also sound engineering solutions and attention to detail, the foundation of all we do.
            </p>
            <h5>RE-BUILDS</h5>
            <p>
                We undertake complete vehicle rebuilds, and past restorations include an MG Midget to ‘better than ex-works’
                concours condition and a 1275 Mini Cooper ‘S’ Mk 2, restored to its original condition.
                This can be carried out either on an entire project or ‘budgeted stages’ basis.
            </p>

            <h5>VALVE CONVERSION</h5>
            <p>
                Cylinder head valve conversions for unleaded fuel is the only truly practical solution for extending the life of older
                classic cars in regular use and also eliminates the need for expensive leaded fuel or additives.
                <br>
                <br>
                Fitting ‘modern’ valve seat inserts is a skilled task and we have invested in specialist equipment from the
                leaders in this field, SERDI. The existing (‘old’) valve seats are machined out and the head is then heated
                (to expand it) whilst the new valve seats are cooled in liquid nitrogen (to ‘shrink’ them).
                <br>
                <br>
                The ‘frozen’ valve seats are then inserted into the close-tolerance machined recesses in the head. When
                all items reach a uniform temperature the inserts are immovable within the head. Each valve seat is then
                carefully machined on the SERDI machine so that the seats, valves and guides are all precision engineered.
                <br>
                <br>
                The head is now ready for thousands of miles of trouble free motoring on unleaded pump fuel.
