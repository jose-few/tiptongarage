            <h5>A WIDE VARIETY OF SERVICES</h5>
            <p>
                At highly competitive rates, a routine service to the manufacturer’s schedule at the Tipton Garage
                is backed by the teams’ specialist engineering knowledge, bringing additional value to the
                maintenance of any modern car… and especially when expertise finds solutions to
                those ‘hard to solve’ problems that sometimes occur.
            </p>
            <h5>REPAIRS</h5>
            <p>
                Damaged cylinder heads, even those which look at first sight to be well beyond recovery,
                can be expertly repaired. This can enable rare and cherished engines to be kept
                running and can also prove to be considerably cheaper than buying, or in some cases even
                re-manufacturing, a new head.
            </p>
            <h5>NEW HEAD CASES</h5>
            <p>
                Complete engines can be hand built to an original specification or to improve performance,
                using some or all of these specialist techniques. We have built modern and classic engines,
                for both road and track use, ranging from Sunbeam, Austin Healey 3000 and Sprite to BMW M3
                and Mercedes.
